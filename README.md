# Logistic Regression Project

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to perform binary classification on a synthetic or real-world dataset. The goal is to predict the target variable based on input features using supervised machine learning.

## Key Steps
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Feature Selection and Scaling  
- Model Training using Logistic Regression  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

## Results
- Achieved 87% Accuracy
- Visualized Confusion Matrix using Seaborn

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
